= Log4j Scala API

{project-name} provides a Scala-friendly interface to log against {log4j-api-url}[the Log4j API].
It supports Scala `2.10`, `2.11`, `2.12`, `2.13`, and `3`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is just a logging API.
Your application still needs to have a logging backend (e.g., {log4j-url}[Log4j]) configured.
====

[#dependencies]
== Dependencies

You need to have the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api-scala` dependency in your classpath:

[source,sbt,subs="+attributes"]
----
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.apache.logging.log4j" %% "log4j-api-scala" % "{project-version}"
)
----

Java module name is set to `org.apache.logging.log4j.api.scala`.
OSGi ``Bundle-SymbolicName``s are set to `org.apache.logging.log4j.api.scala.2.10`, `org.apache.logging.log4j.api.scala.2.11`, and so on.

[#usage]
== Usage

Using the Scala API is as simple as mixing in the `Logging` trait to your class:

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.scala.Logging
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Level

class MyClass extends BaseClass with Logging {

  def doStuff(): Unit = {
    logger.info("Doing stuff")
  }

  def doStuffWithLevel(level: Level): Unit = {
    logger(level, "Doing stuff with arbitrary level")
  }

  def doStuffWithUser(user: User): Unit = {
    logger.info(s"Doing stuff with ${user.getName}.")
  }

}
----

[#params]
== Parameter substitution

Unlike in Java, Scala provides native functionality for string interpolation https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html[beginning in Scala 2.10].
As all logger calls are implemented as macros, using string interpolation directly does not require additional if checks:

[source,scala]
----
logger.debug(s"Logging in user ${user.getName} with birthday ${user.calcBirthday}")
----

[#logger-names]
== Logger names

Most logging implementations use a hierarchical scheme for matching logger names with logging configuration.
In this scheme the logger name hierarchy is represented by `.` characters in the logger name, in a fashion very similar to the hierarchy used for Java/Scala package names.
The `Logger` property added by the `Logging` trait follows this convention: the trait ensures the `Logger` is automatically named according to the class it is being used in.
