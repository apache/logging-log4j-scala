    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.tmpl.adoc` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    `_constants.adoc` is auto-generated from `_constants.tmpl.adoc`.
    Auto-generation happens during `process-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Edit `_constants.tmpl.adoc`
    2. Run `./mvnw process-sources`
    3. Commit both `_constants.tmpl.adoc` and the generated `_constants.adoc`
