    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-13-0-0]
=== 13.0.0

Release date:: 2023-10-10

The highlights of this major release are Scala 3 support, OSGi and JPMS descriptors, and the switch to https://semver.org[semantic versioning].

Note that this release is still binary backward compatible with the earlier release `12.0`.
Though we needed to bump the major version number for the semantic versioning switch to avoid the confusion related with version ordering.


==== Added

* Add support for Scala 3 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3184[LOG4J2-3184], https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j-scala/pull/26[26])
* Add OSGi and JPMS support

==== Changed

* Bump the Java version to 17 (Scala 2.10 and 2.11 targets still require Java 8 that build switches to using `maven-toolchains-plugin`)
* Switch the CI to GitHub Actions
* Switch from `sbt` to Maven to take advantage of `logging-parent` conveniences
* Switch to semantic versioning
* Update `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` version to `2.20.0`
* Update `org.apache.logging:logging-parent` to version `10.1.1`
* Start using `log4j-changelog`
